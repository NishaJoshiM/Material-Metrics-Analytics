## Project Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive statistical analysis of material performance data** sourced from an Intel database. The dataset includes measurements of **voltage, temperature, efficiency, mass, and flow rate** for low-strength and high-strength products.  

Using Microsoft Excel’s **Data Analysis Toolpak**, the project applies **descriptive statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, and **data visualizations** (including histograms and bar/box plots) to provide insights into material performance and trends.

The analysis evaluates key performance metrics to determine statistical differences and trends across product types, providing actionable insights based on the data.

## Key Features
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis.  
- **Hypothesis Testing:** One-sample and two-sample t-tests to evaluate statistical differences between groups.  
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, bar charts, and box-and-whisker plots for clear data interpretation.  
- **Insights:** Highlights statistically significant trends in material performance.
